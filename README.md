## General info
This project is a GUI application that uses JavaFX libraries and SceneBuilder to help create a fully functional MP3 music player that can run directly through your terminal. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java
* JDK version: 17
* JavaFX
* SceneBuilder
* IntelliJ IDEA

## Functionality
I used SceneBuilder to create a layout of the MP3 player and attached methods I've created to each container and control. <b />
Each button located on the MP3 music player is fully functional.
* Play - a functional button that allows the user to begin playing a song from a default playlist I've created
* Pause - a functional button that allows the user to pause the current song that is playing
* Reset - a functional button that allows the user to restart the current song that is playing back from the beginning
* Previous - a functional menu button that allows the to go back to the previous page you've visited
* Next - a functional button that allows the user to proceed to the following song within the default playlist
* Speed - a functional button that allows the user to change the speed of the song
* Volume bar - a functional slider bar that allows the user to slide the button left or right to increase or decrease the volume
* Loading bar - a functional progress bar that is linked to the duration of the current song playing
* Title screen - a label that displays the artist name and song
